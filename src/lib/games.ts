    description: 'The Despicable Circus had its most brilliant moment many years ago, when a romance bloomed that would end in tragedy. Madame Pompery and Candyclown had fallen in love, but not with the same intensity. Soon the clown began to feel jealous, and in a burst of madness, he killed all the circus performers and finally took his own life. What no one imagined was that, even after death, the clown would continue claiming his victims. For many years, and even today, people speak of the "Curse of the Despicable Circus," also known as the "Curse of the Freaks," because everyone who enters the abandoned circus tents never sees the light of day again. Recently, Mr. Despicable has taken over the circus and has every intention of making it something grand again, but he will need the help of some brave souls to end the curse so he can take the circus from town to town once more.',

    description: 'In his final days, Nikola Tesla wasn\'t just working on wireless energy; he was crafting a paradox. He discovered a secret that could change the timeline of human history, but a shadowy organization stole his research and silenced him. He hid his final work in this, his long-lost laboratory, protected by arcane technology and puzzles only a genius could devise. The lab pulses with mysterious energy, filled with impossible inventions and cryptic blueprints that seem to bend the laws of physics. Your team must reactivate his machines, decode his revolutionary discoveries, and uncover the "Tesla Protocol" before his rivals return to erase it—and you—from existence. But beware: tampering with time itself may have consequences none of you can imagine.',
